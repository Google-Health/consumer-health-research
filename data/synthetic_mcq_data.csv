"A patient undergoes polysomnography. During quiet wakefulness, no posterior alpha rhythm is observed when
the eyes are closed. Which of the following statements is correct?
(A) With no clear posterior dominant alpha rhythm, sleep stage N1 cannot be definitively determined.
(B) If average background frequency during wakefulness is 8Hz, stage N1 can be defined only if activity
decreases to ≤ 6Hz.
(C) Stage N1 can be scored if EEG demonstrates sharply contoured waves that are most prominent over central
region and last <0.5 seconds.
(D) Sleep stage N1 can be scored with rapid eye movement.
(E) Sleep stage N1 can be scored with a brief series of waves at 12-14Hz, lasting 2 seconds and most prominent
in central derivation.","{'(A)': 'With no clear posterior dominant alpha rhythm, sleep stage N1 cannot be definitively determined.', '(B)': 'If average background frequency during wakefulness is 8Hz, stage N1 can be defined only if activity decreases to ≤ 6Hz.', '(C)': 'Stage N1 can be scored if EEG demonstrates sharply contoured waves that are most prominent over central region and last <0.5 seconds.', '(D)': 'Sleep stage N1 can be scored with rapid eye movement.', '(E)': 'Sleep stage N1 can be scored with a brief series of waves at 12-14Hz, lasting 2 seconds and most prominent in central derivation.'}",Sleep,Moderate,(C)
